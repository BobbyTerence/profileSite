                <h2>Projects:</h2>
                    <h3>Simple Text File Database in C:</h3>
                    <p>My last semester at Truman, I took a class for C and assembly. Our midterm project was to create a console application that allowed the user to read, edit, and add course data to a .txt file. This was by far one of my favorite projects, and really made me learn how dynamic memory allocation and garbage handling functioned.</p>

                    <h3>Manipulating Data with COBOL:</h3>
                    <p>One of the languages we learn at State Tech is COBOL. Our final project for this class was to read, edit, and add data to a .dat file. This project was particularly challenging due to some of COBOLâ€™s intricacies and how it handles data.</p>
